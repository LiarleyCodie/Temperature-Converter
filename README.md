# Temperature Converter

:jack_o_lantern: I'm just using built-in libraries to do everything you can see.

:baby_bottle: I'm very beginner so I made this project just to practice

:lemon: At this time, the user only can choose a temperature that he wants to convert, but all instructions that convert are not configure

:grapes: This is the first time i've used methods like turning a character to uppercase, clearing the console, and getting input from user's keyboard
