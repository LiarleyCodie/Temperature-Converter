# Temperature Converter

:jack_o_lantern: I'm just using built-in libraries to do everything you can see.

:baby_bottle: I'm very beginner so I made this project just to practice

:lemon: At this time, the user only can choose a temperature that he wants to convert, but all instructions that convert are not configured

:grapes: This is the first time i've used methods like turning a character to uppercase, clearing the console, and getting input from user's keyboard

:see_no_evil: I discovered with this project that the `string` data type needs to be imported using `std` just as it would be done with methods like `cout` or `cin`.

> The facility i had for things to be done in javascript makes everything in c++ a fun novelty.
